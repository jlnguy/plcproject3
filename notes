Ada Pseudocode

- Initialize Stack -

Read from input. 
	If input is an integer, push to stack
		Integer is one character. I.e. 89 is 8 and 9.
	If input is a symbol, (switch-case)
		. Addition
		+ Minimum
		// Implication that there are parenthesis and order of operations
		0 Infinity
		1 Zero 
		* Urnary Operation; returns infinity
		
		Then take the symbol with its translation and pop 2. 
		Push the result back into the stack.
		If another symbol comes in, pop 2.
		
	If end of line, print result. (One singular number)
	Wait for more input.
